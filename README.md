After working for years in the lead Art + Tech organisation in the UK (FACT Liverpool), I am embracing tech fully and becoming a Full Stack Software Developer. As a Creative Producer at FACT, I had the chance to manage and coordinate multiple projects. Those involved, most of the time, incredibly talented Software Developers - watching and learning from them fed my curiosity, inspiring me to be better. I wanted to learn how they made *the magic* happen! 

Training at Command Shift (formerly Manchester Codes), has prepared me over the last 6 months to produce clear, readable code and to develop creative solutions to the challenges along the way. I am deeply passionate about telling stories- may that be writing a novel or delivering a tech workshop or through coding apps for users, and I am currently looking for entry level roles where I can continue to develop, while helping a company share their vision with the world.

| ![booklibrary](https://github.com/C-Marfil/CV/blob/main/images/erd.png) | [Book Library](https://github.com/C-Marfil/book_library.git)      | 3 weeks |  Express API that helped me brush up my skills on routing and interacting with Databases using Sequelize. Tested with Mocha, Chai and Supertest. |

An interactive star map web app that archives the lived experiences of Black Trans youth. I managed/implemented most of the content through a CMS. |

#### Collaboration

- I support honesty, clear communication and healthy feedback loops.

#### Art in the Everyday

#### Learning

- I have worked as an informal educator for a long time, which has allowed me to really understand how people process information. I am extremely confident at communicating ideas (and often translating them to other, less tech savvy, minds), presenting/public speaking and providing structure that allows people to develop and test their skills safely.
- I am always searching for new things to read. I love learning and I will always be trying to find new skills and topics about which I can learn more.
