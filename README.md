After working for years in the lead Art + Tech organisation in the UK (FACT Liverpool), I am expanding my career by becoming a Software Developer. As a Creative Producer at FACT, I had the chance to manage and coordinate multiple projects involving incredibly inspiring Softare Developers - watching and learning about their work appealed to my eagerness to learn and to develop as a professional. I wanted to learn how they make *the magic* happen. 

Training at Command Shift (formerly Manchester Codes), has prepared me over the last 6 months to produce clear, readable code and to develop creative solutions to any challenges. I am deeply passionate about telling stories- may that be writing a novel or delivering a tech workshop or through music, and I am currently looking for entry level roles where I can continue to develop while helping a company to share their vision.

## Skills

#### Collaboration

- I support honesty, clear communication and healthy feedback loops.
- I have a very holistic understanding of my work, this helps me to support other members of my team without forgetting the team's goals and the bigger picture.
- I have led project participants and teams to produce complex work. This involved agile project management tools such as Asana, Trello or Slack as well as delivering workshops and implementing safeguarding/diversity policies in the workplace.

#### Art in the Everyday

- I am very passionate about Art that merges with the technology we use everyday. This lens allows me to understand my work in front of a computer as potentially artistic.
- I always strive to use my creative perspective when approaching challenges.
- My artistic interest range from using Social Media in ways that was not intended to be used, to 3D modelling, video editing and writing articles about videogames, VR, AR, AI...

#### Learning

- I have worked as an informal educator for a long time, which has allowed me to really understand how people process information. I am extremely confident at communicating ideas (and often translating them to other, less technical, minds), presenting/public speaking and providing structure that allows people to develop and test their skills safely.
- I am always searching for new things to read. I love learning and I will always be trying to find new skills and topics about which I can learn more.
